## The Factory Pattern

- Software design pattern to separate creation from use – powerful technique.
- Create objects in a different place than where you use them.
- This is very helpful, because the code then doesn’t need to know anything about how the objects are created when you use them. This mean that if at a later stage you decide to change out those objects with other objects, you don’t have to change the original code.
- The factory facilitates the creation, allowing you to use those objects without knowing the specifics.
